Attack Path Explorer + Predictive Vulnerability Graph

Idea:
Build a Neo4j or TigerGraph system that constructs attack graphs for a simulated enterprise network (using open datasets like MITRE ATT&CK, CVE/NVD, BloodHound sample data).
Add ML + LLM agents that:

• infer likely attack paths
• predict the next step of an attacker
• suggest mitigations
• simulate how a vulnerability propagates
• generate “blast radius” analysis

Tech stack:
Neo4j + FastAPI + Vertex AI agents (or LangGraph) + GCP Cloud Run + CI/CD + BigQuery for logs.

Why this passes scrutiny:
Attack graphs are a legit cybersecurity technique. You’re applying graph ML and agent reasoning meaningfully, not decoratively.

Where to challenge yourself:
Explain why your predictions make sense from an adversary behavior standpoint. Avoid “because the model said so.”


It shows:

• graph intelligence
• ML prediction
• LLM reasoning
• cloud deployment
• security understanding
• agentic pipelines
• systems engineering maturity
• explainability under pressure

It is also defensible. A skeptic can question your assumptions, and you’ll have answers grounded in both graph theory and security logic.

The meta-point for your intellectual rigor

Whatever you build, ensure you can defend:

• why your model works
• how the data reflects real attack surfaces
• what failure modes look like
• what assumptions you’re making about adversaries
• how your system behaves when wrong
• how you validated it
• why it’s cloud-native, not just cloud-hosted
• what unique insight your design embodies

Security interviewers love candidates who know why something works more than what they built.

If you want, we can pick one of the above ideas and start architecting it with deep reasoning—data sources, MLOps stack, attack graph schemas, agent design, deployment pipeline, the works.
